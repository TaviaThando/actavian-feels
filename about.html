            She grew up under Southern skies, where dusty winds carried ancient
            lullabies. Her childhood was filled with quiet questions and a
            hunger to remember things she never saw.

            Now, she lives in the pause — between breath and poem, between

            She writes again not because she’s healed, but because writing is
            how she survives. These poems? They’re whispers for the ones still
            learning how to speak.
