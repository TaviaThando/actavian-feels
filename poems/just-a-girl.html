        <p><em>a quiet reflection</em></p>

        <div class="poem-body">
          <pre>
          I’m just a girl, I say.
          What does that even mean?
          I say it without delay.
          But the question sits between…
          My ribs, my dreams, my quiet scream.
          I want to be alone,
          But only if they miss me.
          I crave the hush of solitude,
          But ache when love feels distant, empty.
          Some days are sunlit,
          Laughter dancing on my skin.
          I float in warmth, unbroken,
          Like happiness is pouring in.
          Other days are storm thick,
          Dark corners in my mind.
          I smile so no one notices
          The fear I hide behind.
          I don’t know how to say it
          The things that shake my core.
          So I run, I disappear,
          I close every open door.
          </pre>

          <pre>
            But still—
            I hold my own hand in the dark.
            I trace my black spots like constellations.
            I say, “You’re enough,” in the mirror
            Like it’s a daily incantation.
          </pre>

          <pre>
            And yet—
            Sometimes I dream of a voice,
            Soft as dusk,
            Calling me, like it’s not a choice.
            Someone who sees past my quiet,
            And stays through my dismay,
            Even when I push them away.
            Because they love me enough to wait by the edge,
            To call through the silence,
            And stay while the storm stirs the ledge.
            I love loud in silence,
            With glances and long looks away.
            I’m trying, in my own language,
            To let the people I love stay.
          </pre>

          <pre>
            I’m just a girl, I say.
            And maybe that’s everything.
            A question. A contradiction.
            A heart still blossoming.
            Maybe I’ll never know
            How to say what I feel,
            But I’ll keep reaching, keep unfolding,
            Because that too, is real.
          </pre>

          <pre>
            So I’m just a girl,
            And maybe that’s enough…
            A question, a contradiction,
            A heart learning how to love.
